Project 10: Compiler Optimization
Overview
Project 10 in the Nand to Tetris course focuses on compiler optimization techniques. The goal of this project is to enhance the performance and efficiency of the Jack language compiler built in previous projects by implementing various optimization strategies. Optimizations can significantly improve the execution speed and resource utilization of programs generated by the compiler.

Key Concepts
Compiler Optimization:
Compiler optimization involves analyzing the intermediate representation of code generated by the compiler and applying transformations to produce optimized code.
Optimization Techniques:
Common optimization techniques include constant folding, dead code elimination, loop optimization, inline expansion, and register allocation.
Jack Compiler:
The Jack compiler translates programs written in the Jack language (a simplified, object-oriented language) into equivalent VM code.
Project 10 extends the compiler by integrating optimization passes to improve code quality and performance.

Project Structure
JackCompiler: (JackCompiler.java, JackTokenizer.java, CompilationEngine.java, SymbolTable.java, VMWriter.java)
Implements lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, code generation, and optimization stages of compilation.
Optimization Passes:
Each optimization pass focuses on a specific aspect of code optimization (e.g., constant folding, dead code elimination).
Optimizations are applied during the compilation process to transform code for better performance.
Jack Files:
Contains sample Jack language files (.jack) for compilation and optimization testing.
